# Hickory Blockchain â€” React + Vite + Tailwind

This project reproduces the Hickory Blockchain marketing site as a production-ready React application built on Vite and Tailwind CSS. All copy, layout, and behaviors from the original static HTML have been preserved.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Production Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Features

- Dark-mode aware rendering with IBM Plex Sans typography
- Scroll-triggered reveals, tokenomics hover interactions, cookie consent banner
- External link hardening and SEO metadata (Open Graph, Twitter, JSON-LD)
- Tailwind-based styling with custom utilities mirroring the original design

Static assets (logos, docs) should be placed under `public/` to mirror the referenced paths.
